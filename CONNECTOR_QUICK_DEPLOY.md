# Connector Game - Quick Deploy to Railway ðŸš€

## Fastest Way to Deploy (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy Python Service

```bash
# Navigate to python service
cd backend/python-service

# Login to Railway (if not already)
railway login

# Create new project
railway init

# Link to new service
railway link

# Deploy!
railway up
```

Railway will give you a URL like: `https://connector-python-production.up.railway.app`

### Step 2: Update Backend Environment Variable

In your Railway dashboard for your **main TypeScript backend**:

1. Go to Variables
2. Add new variable:
   ```
   PYTHON_SERVICE_URL=https://connector-python-production.up.railway.app
   ```
3. Click "Deploy" (automatic redeploy)

### Step 3: Test

Visit your app â†’ Feed â†’ Connector tab â†’ You should see 1471 jobs!

## Alternative: One-Command Deploy

If you're already in Railway and want to add the Python service to your existing project:

```bash
cd backend/python-service
railway up
```

Then add the environment variable as shown in Step 2.
