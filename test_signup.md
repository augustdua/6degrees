# Signup Flow Test

## 🧪 Testing the Fixed Signup Flow

**Frontend is running at:** http://localhost:8080

### **Test Steps:**

1. **Go to Signup Page:**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/auth
   - Click on "Sign Up" tab

2. **Fill in Signup Form:**
   ```
   First Name: Test
   Last Name: User
   Email: test@example.com (use a real email you can access)
   Password: TestPassword123!
   ```

3. **Submit Form:**
   - Click "Sign Up" button
   - ✅ **Expected:** Should see "Account Created! Please check your email to verify your account before signing in"
   - ✅ **Expected:** Form switches to Sign In tab with email pre-filled
   - ❌ **Old behavior:** Would redirect to dashboard and crash

4. **Check Email:**
   - Look for Supabase confirmation email
   - Click the confirmation link

5. **Sign In:**
   - Use the same credentials to sign in
   - ✅ **Expected:** Successfully logs in and goes to dashboard

### **Previous Error (Now Fixed):**
- User would get redirected to dashboard immediately after signup
- Dashboard would crash because user wasn't authenticated yet
- Database errors when trying to create user profile

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ Fixed signup flow (no immediate redirect)
- ✅ Better user messaging
- ⚠️ Need to apply database migration for automatic user profile creation
- ⚠️ Backend not running (environment variable issue)

---

## 🔧 To Complete the Fix:

1. **Apply Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   supabase login
   supabase link --project-ref tfbwfcnjdmbqmoyljeys
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **The migration will:**
   - Create automatic trigger for user profile creation
   - Handle all user metadata properly
   - Eliminate RLS permission errors

**Current test results will show improved UX even without the migration!**
