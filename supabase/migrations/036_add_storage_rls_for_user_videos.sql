-- STORAGE RLS POLICIES FOR USER ISOLATION
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- NOTE: These policies CANNOT be created via SQL Editor due to permissions.
-- You must create them in the Supabase Dashboard instead.
--
-- Go to: Storage > 6DegreeRequests > Policies > New Policy
-- 
-- This file documents the policies that need to be created manually.
-- See STORAGE-POLICIES-SETUP.md for step-by-step instructions.

-- =====================================================

-- This migration file is intentionally empty since storage policies
-- must be created through the Supabase Dashboard UI.

-- For reference, see the STORAGE-POLICIES-SETUP.md file for the exact
-- policies that need to be created.
