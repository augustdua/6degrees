# Logging & Timeout Fixes

## Changes Made:

### 1. ✅ Reduced Auth Logging (backend/src/middleware/auth.ts)
**Before:** Every auth check logged 8+ lines with emojis
**After:** Only logs errors

**Impact:** Console logs reduced by ~95% for auth checks

### 2. ✅ Increased Timeout for Avatar Training (frontend/src/lib/api.ts)
**Before:** 15 second timeout for ALL requests
**After:** 
- 180 seconds (3 minutes) for avatar training/generation
- 30 seconds for normal API calls

**Impact:** Avatar training no longer times out

### 3. ✅ Reduced API Request Logging
**Before:** 8+ console.logs per API request
**After:** Only logs errors

**Impact:** Much cleaner console output

## Files Changed:
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts` - Removed excessive auth logging
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Increased timeout for avatar operations, reduced logging

## Result:
- ✅ Console much cleaner (90%+ reduction in logs)
- ✅ Avatar training won't timeout anymore
- ✅ Only errors are logged (easier debugging)
- ✅ All normal functionality preserved
